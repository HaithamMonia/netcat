# Netcat

Netcat is a versatile networking utility that reads and writes data across network connections using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, as it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
